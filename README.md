Proxy-Guided Clustering: Enhancing K-Means with Learned Density-Aware Augmentations

# Proxy-Guided Clustering using Gradient Boosted Trees

A novel density-aware clustering pipeline that uses a learned **proxy signal** to enhance the quality of KMeans segmentation. This approach combines **localized LOF**, **Gradient Boosted Regression**, and **feature-space augmentation** to improve cluster coherence and separation â€” especially in high-dimensional, mixed or noisy datasets.

## ðŸš€ Overview

Traditional clustering algorithms like KMeans are sensitive to scale, outliers, and density variations. This project introduces a novel hybrid approach:

1. **Estimate Local Density:**  
   Use Local Outlier Factor (LOF), normalized within regions via MiniBatchKMeans.

2. **Learn a Proxy Function:**  
   Train a Gradient Boosted Regressor to approximate the density signal.

3. **Augmented Feature:**  
   Append predicted density as an additional feature to original input.

4. **Cluster in Augmented Space:**  
   Apply KMeans on the enriched feature space for improved segmentation.

## Key Contributions

âœ… **Proxy Learning with GBDTs:**  
KMeans enhanced by density-predicted signals, simulating behavior of density-aware models like DBSCAN.
Train GBR to regress the LOF-derived "density score" using original features.
The regressor now learns a mapping from raw features to density, approximating local structure.

KMeans now clusters based on:
- Original feature geometry
- Learned density structure

âœ… **Region-wise Normalized LOF:**  
Improves robustness and interpretability by adapting LOF to local structures.
LOF gives us a way to estimate how central/dense a point is in its neighborhood.
But LOF is non-differentiable, non-parametric, and hard to scale for large datasets.
Local normalization of LOF across KMeans-defined regions creates a smoothed, interpretable proxy for "density score".

âœ… **Hybrid Evaluation with Gower Distance:**  
Gower distance adds cohesion interpretability beyond geometric metrics.

GBR bridges the gap between:
- Unsupervised structure (via LOF)
- Supervised function approximation (via regression)
- And density-aware clustering (via augmented KMeans)

âœ… **Early-Stopped Regressor:**  
Optimized GBR via validation-based early stopping to prevent proxy overfitting.
